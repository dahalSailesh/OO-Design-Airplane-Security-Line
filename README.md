# OO-Design: Airport Security Line

Q3:
  You are in charge of making the lines at airport security run smoothly. Every day thousands of people
  pass through security. There are 3 main types of people who go through this line: economy class
  passengers, VIP passengers, and flight staff. There is one line but some people have the ability to cut
  through. The system should allow VIPs and flight staff go straight to the scanners. They are rare
  occurrences and only appear 1 in every 100 people.
